## Introduction

Scrap2Art offers a unique platform where individuals can sell their old or scrap items, while artists can purchase these items to transform them into customized, creative products. The app promotes recycling, allows users to earn money, and supports the #VocalForLocal initiative.

### #VocalForLocal

## What is this project about? What does this app do?

Scrap2Art is an app that helps people sell old stuff and artists turn them into cool items. You can buy, customize, and make money while helping the environment.

## Target Audience

1. Individuals looking to sell their old items
2. Artists interested in buying scraps to create unique pieces
3. Those passionate about recycling and supporting local initiatives.

## Novelty / Uniqueness

The uniqueness of Scrap2Art lies in its **dual purpose**: allowing **users to sell their old items** while enabling **artists to buy these items at a *lower cost to create custom pieces***. This combination promotes **recycling**, **creativity**, and **income generation**. The app also emphasizes the #VocalForLocal initiative, supporting local artists and materials. Additional features like in-app messaging, business tips, and online branding tips enhance the overall user experience.

## Motivation behind this project

I created this project because I saw my mother's love for art and the struggle with pricey supplies. I wanted to make a place **where artists could find affordable materials** and **people could sell their old items**. Artists get cheaper supplies, a platform to showcase their work, and can earn. Users can clear clutter, earn money, and support local talent. It's a win-win situation!

## Team

### How was the tasks assigned?

The tasks in our two-person team were allocated **based on our individual interests and expertise**. I took on the responsibility of managing the app's overall design and frontend development. This involved designing the user interface from scratch using Figma and implementing the frontend functionalities + documentation. Additionally, I successfully handled the crucial aspect of user authentication through email. On the other hand, Rishabh focused on the backend part of the app, managing database processes, backend-to-frontend and backend-to-backend connectivity, and in-app messaging.

### My Role

1. **Design**: Responsible for the overall design of the app, creating its visual appearance and layout.
2. **Frontend Development**: Coded the frontend part of the app, making the user interface functional and interactive.
3. **User Interface**: Designed the user interface (UI) of the app from scratch using Figma, deciding how all the elements should look and be arranged.
4. **User Authentication**: Managed the process where users log in using their email, ensuring it's secure and easy to use.
5. **Collaboration**: Worked closely with Rishabh to ensure the frontend and backend of the app fit together seamlessly.

#### Project Difficulties

The implementation of motion design was affecting the app's performance. We addressed this by coding the motion design in-app itself rather than adding it as an external file.


## Future Scope

- Implement reviews and ratings to foster a stronger community.
- Partner with environmental organizations or initiatives to highlight the app's contributions to recycling and sustainability.
- Introduce negotiation features between buyers and sellers.
